The database schema is ready. BUild the backend project API routes only.

## Routes

Create REST endpoint for:

- 'GET /api.projects', list current user's projects
- 'POST /api/projects', create project
- 'PATCH /api/projects/[projectId]', rename project
- 'DELETE /api/projects/[projectId]', delete project

## Rules

Use the authenticated Clerk user ID as 'ownerId'.

When creating:

- default missing project name to 'Untitled Project'
- use the schema's existing ID strategy, do not add sequential IDs.

Security:

- unathenticated requests return '401'
- only the project owner can rename or delete
- non-owner mutations return '403'

Keep this backend-only. Do not wire the UI yet.

## Check When Done

- routes exist for list/create/rename/delete
- owner checks are enforced for rename/delete
- '401' and '403' responses are handled correctly
- 'npm run build' passes
